#  Exoplanet Prediction in Deep Space using DeepNet and Advance Ensemble 

> Prediction of whether a planet is exoplanet or not.

> Exoplanet is any planet in other solar system(s) and its presence is determined with the help of flux of the star the exoplanet is revolving.

> Algorithms used - Deep Sequential Model (ANN), Advanced Ensemble - LightGBM, HistGBM, XGBoost

> Tuned parameters are stores in the Tuner Params directory (zipped). Can be used to study the architecture of the DeepNet model. 

> ! Warning ! - better run the code in environment with CUDA, CUDNN
