# Exoplanet Prediction in Deep Space using DeepNet and Advanced Ensemble 

## Objective
Predict whether a planet is an exoplanet or not.

## Definition
An exoplanet is any planet in other solar systems, and its presence is determined by analyzing the flux of the star it is revolving around.

## Algorithms Used
- Deep Sequential Model (ANN): Utilized Keras Tuner for hyperparameter tuning, achieving an accuracy of 51.62%.

- Advanced Ensemble:
  - XGBoost: Hyperparameter tuned to achieve an accuracy of 96%.
  - LightGBM: Hyperparameter tuned to achieve an accuracy of 97.19%.
  - HistGBM: Hyperparameter tuned to achieve an accuracy of 97.45%.

## Tuned Parameters
Tuned parameters are stored in the 'Tuner Params' directory (zipped) and can be used to study the architecture of the DeepNet model.
